# BillyGene
Project for 2019 edition of pixels.camp

# Billy Gene is not our model, it's just a code who claims to find the equations.

The aim is to automatically find physical models for things like trajectories, ballistics, black body radiation, general relativity and quantum field theory, for example, using genetic programming.
We will extract real sensor data using Microsoft's Azure IoT to deduce physics out of thin air.

## How we're doing it
There are two parts of our project. The hardware, which we are implementing in Arduino, and the genetic algorithms, implemented in MATLAB and Python.


### Genetic Algorithms

If you don't believe in the theory of evolution, then you're not going to like our project. We base our methods on the basis of natural selection and evolution. DNA is an ever changing molecule that parents pass onto their children, with a maximum of variability among them: each parent pass half of their DNA, with added randomisation: there's mutations and crossovers. That's the whole idea for a genetic algorithm: it's an evolutionary fit that has generations of parents that procreate, with added randomness for mutation (random change in the values) or crossover (switch between parents on certain positions).

### But really, what are we doing?

We're aiming low: we want to revolutionise physics. Yes, the whole field. The idea is that maybe with these algorithms we can come up with the equations that took the fathers of physics YEARS to arrive to. It might be an ambitious idea, but what else can we get when 50% of our team are physicists?

This is the plan: we throw our pretty IoT device in the air and we feed the data that it connects to our algorithms, which will come up with the equations to describe the movement. Who would win, Galileo or Billy Gene?
